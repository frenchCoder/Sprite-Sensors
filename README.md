# Sprite-Sensors
A unity project that contains 3 agents and at least 2 walls.  The main agent will move based on user input.  It can rotate its heading or move forward/backward.  The main agent will also contain three classes.  Each class represents a different type of sensor for the main agent to interpret other objects in its environment.
